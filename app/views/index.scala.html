            <h2>Big Screen Top 10</h2>

            <p>The orignal classic-style dashboard, ideal for people who sit a long way from their screens,
                on mobile devices, or who can&rsquo;t find their glasses right now.</p>

            <p>Shows the top ten most accessed pages over the last 15 minutes in a single Top of the Pops inspired list.</p>

            <p><a class="btn" href="@routes.Application.top10()">Show Me &raquo;</a></p>

        <div class="span-one-third">
            <h2>Top 20</h2>

            <p>Designed for local desktop use.</p>

            <p>Shows the top twenty most accessed pages over the last 15 minutes, split into content pages
            and everything else.</p>

            <p><a class="btn" href="@routes.Application.top20()">Show Me &raquo;</a></p>

                This dashboard works by reading server logs and is still in relative infancy.
                Please be aware of its potential limitations:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>Only traffic to www.guardian.co.uk is monitored.
                    (Specifically, traffic from guardiannews.com is <strong>not</strong> included.)</li>
                <li>It samples 10% of site traffic. Experience suggests this gives a good overall picture, but could mislead.</li>

                <li>Currently, bot traffic is not excluded. This <em>will</em> mislead. (We&rsquo;re working on this.)</li>

            </ul>

            <p><span class="label notice">EXPERIMENTAL</span> Overlay overall hits per second when browsing the live
            site. Be careful: it shows overall hits for the page the link points at, NOT how many people clicked the link.
            Use SiteCatalyst's heat map for that!</p>
