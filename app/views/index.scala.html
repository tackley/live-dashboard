            <h2>Big Screen Top 10</h2>

            <p>The orignal classic-style dashboard, ideal for people who sit a long way from their screens,
                on mobile devices, or who can&rsquo;t find their glasses right now.</p>

            <p>Shows the top ten most accessed pages over the last 15 minutes in a single Top of the Pops inspired list.</p>

            <p>Designed for local desktop use.</p>

            <p>Shows the top twenty most accessed pages over the last 15 minutes, split into content pages

                This dashboard works by reading server logs and is still in relative infancy.
                Please be aware of its potential limitations:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>Only traffic to www.guardian.co.uk is monitored.
                    (Specifically, traffic from guardiannews.com is <strong>not</strong> included.)</li>
                <li>It samples 10% of site traffic. Experience suggests this gives a good overall picture, but could mislead.</li>

                <li>Currently, bot traffic is not excluded. This <em>will</em> mislead. (We&rsquo;re working on this.)</li>

            </ul>

            <h2>Overlay View</h2>

            <p>Overlay overall hits per second when browsing the live
            site. Be careful: it shows overall hits for the page the link points at, NOT how many people clicked the link.
            Use SiteCatalyst's heat map for that!</p>
